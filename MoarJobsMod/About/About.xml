  <name>[A17] Moar Jobs Mod</name>
  <author>Bryan Bettis</author>
  <description>A combined version of my divided/additional jobs and job/task tweak mods. Each job/tweak can be enabled and in the mods settings (some jobs/tweaks have additional configuration options) and is configured separately for each save. If possible/practical will eventually be able to add it to existing saves, including saves that used some of my individual job/task tweak mods.</description>
